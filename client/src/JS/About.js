                <div id="about-me">I'm a recent graduate of the Burlington Code Academy where I made the transition from musician to full stack developer. Although music will always be a passion, I needed a new challenge and direction in my life. As soon as I learned of Burlington Code Academy I started messing around with coding and immediately loved it. Although coding was a total change in direction, certain skills I had learned in past jobs carried over, like design, creative problem-solving and self-discipline. I'm excited to see where this new career will lead me.</div>
